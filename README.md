nanoblog
========

This is a nanoblogging site prototype, course work from Web Application Developement. 

To run this on localhost, clone it first and go the the webapp folder and run "python manage.py runserver". The go to the browser and type url "localhost:8000".

Note that the site does not actually send an email to confirm registration, instead it prints out the url in the shell, copy and paste it to the browser to finish new user registration.
